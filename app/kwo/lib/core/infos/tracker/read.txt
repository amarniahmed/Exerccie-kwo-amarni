Google Analytics tracks online campaigns using a combination of the following five marketing dimensions:

    * Source
    * Medium
    * Term
    * Content
    * Campaign

* Source
Every referral to a web site has an origin, or source. Examples of sources are the
 Google search engine, the AOL search engine, the name of a newsletter, or the name 
of a referring web site.

* Medium
The medium helps to qualify the source; together, the source and medium provide 
specific information about the origin of a referral. For example, in the case of 
a Google search engine source, the medium might be "cost-per-click", indicating 
a sponsored link for which the advertiser paid, or "organic", indicating a link 
in the unpaid search engine results. In the case of a newsletter source, examples 
of medium include "email" and "print".

* Term
The term or keyword is the word or phrase that a user types into a search engine.

* Content
The content dimension describes the version of an advertisement on which a visitor
 clicked. It is used in content-targeted advertising and Content (A/B) Testing to 
determine which version of an advertisement is most effective at attracting 
profitable leads.

* Campaign
The campaign dimension differentiates product promotions such as "Spring Ski Sale" 
or slogan campaigns such as "Get Fit For Summer".
